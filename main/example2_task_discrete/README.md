# Dynamic Movement Prmitives (DMP) vs. Elementary Dynamic Actions (EDA)
This Github repository contains the MuJoCo-python codes for the simulation in Section 3.2 of the [**Robot Control based on Motor Primitives-A Comparison of Two Approaches**](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.18771) written by [Moses C. Nah](https://mosesnah-shared.github.io/about.html), [Johannes Lachner](https://jlachner.github.io/) and [Neville Hogan](https://meche.mit.edu/people/faculty/neville@mit.edu). 

Examples using DMP and EDA are included. 
To run DMP:
```bash
    python -B DMP.py
```

To run EDA:
```bash
    python -B EDA.py
```
